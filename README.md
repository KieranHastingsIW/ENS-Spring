working email end point, working on DB, json to csv will be worked on last 


we can call the apiRequest method in the service impl class multiple times with different emails so if the filtering can be done for Gps this can be done


public void db(String rlsString) {  is where the database is populated with the payloads, if filtering can be done before reaching here we should be able to pop DB correctly
